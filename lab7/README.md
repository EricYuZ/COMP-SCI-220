## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will practice how to...
* Access and utilize data in CSV files
* Deal with messy real-world datasets
* Use dictionaries to organize data into key, value pairs

------------------------------
## Note on Academic Misconduct

You may do these lab exercises only with your project partner; you are not allowed to start 
working on lab-p5 with one person, then do the project with a different partner. Now may be a 
good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f22/syllabus.html).


## Project Partner

We strongly recommend students find a project partner. Pair programming is a great way to learn
from a fellow student. Project difficulty increases exponentially in this course. Finding a project 
partner early on during the semester is a good idea.

If you are still looking for a project partner, take a moment to ask around the room if anyone 
would like to partner with you on this project. Then you can work with them on this lab and the 
project.


------------------------------
## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab-p7` directory and download the following files into the `lab-p7` directory.

* `water_accessibility.csv`
* `practice.ipynb`
* `practice_test.py`

If you found your `.csv` file is downloaded as a `.txt` file (e.g. `water_accessibility.txt` instead of `water_accessibility.csv`), run `mv water_accessibility.txt water_accessibility.csv` from your Powershell/Terminal to change the extension of the file into `.csv` file manually. All the data that we need for p7 is stored in `water_accessibility.csv`

To start, familiarize yourself with the dataset (`water_accessibility.csv`). Examine its contents using Microsoft Excel, Numbers (Mac) or any other spreadsheet viewing software.

------------------------------

## Segments 2: Using dictionaries to analyze the data

You will be finishing the rest of your lab on `practice.ipynb`. Run the command `jupyter notebook` from your Terminal/PowerShell window. 
Remember not to close this 
Terminal/PowerShell window while Jupyter is running, and open a new Terminal/PowerShell 
window if necessary.

**Note**: For p7, you will be working on `p7.ipynb`, which is very similar to `practice.ipynb`. We 
strongly recommend that you finish working on this notebook during the lab, so you can ask 
your TA/PM any questions about the notebook that may arise.

**Note**: Unlike `p7.ipynb`, you do **not** have to submit `practice.ipynb`. This notebook is solely 
for your practice and preparation for p7.

------------------------------

## Segment 3: Otter tests check for project submission

This segment is informational only and has no tasks. Your work on `p7.ipynb` is not complete when you submit the project on Gradescope. It is your responsibility to make sure that your project clears auto-grader tests on the Gradescope test system. Otter test results should be available in a few minutes after your submission. You should be able to see both PASS / FAIL results for the 20 test cases and your total score, which is accessible via Gradescope Dashboard. You must be able to see the following screen on Gradescope:

You **must** review the project's rubric and make sure that you have followed the directions provided in the project to solve the questions. The rubric is meant to reinforce your understanding of the project's directions. TAs and graders will be following the rubric to make deductions on your project submission during manual grading. Rubrics will become progressively stricter as we make progress during this semester.

## Project 7

You can now get started with [p7](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p7). **You may use any helper functions created here in project p7**. Remember to only work with p7 with your partner from this point on. Have fun!
