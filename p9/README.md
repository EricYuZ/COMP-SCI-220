## Instructions:

This project will focus on **bucketizing**, **plotting** and **sorting**. To start, download [`p9.ipynb`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/blob/main/p9/p9.ipynb), [`p9_test.py`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/blob/main/p9/p9_test.py), [`movies.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/raw/main/p9/movies.csv), and [`mapping.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/raw/main/p9/mapping.csv).

If it takes too long to load the files `movies.csv` and `mapping.csv` on GitLab, you can directly download the file from these link: [`movies.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/raw/main/p9/movies.csv), and [`mapping.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/raw/main/p9/mapping.csv). You will need to **Right Click**, and click on the **Save as...** button to save the file through this method.

**Important:** Note that the files `movies.csv` and `mapping.csv` that you worked with in p8 are different from the files here. So do **not** use the files that you used in p8 to solve p9.

You will work on `p9.ipynb` and hand it in. You should follow the provided directions for each question. Questions have **specific** directions on what **to do** and what **not to do**.

------------------------------

## IMPORTANT Submission instructions:
- Review the [Grading Rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p9/rubric.md), to ensure that you don't lose points during code review.
- You must **save your notebook file** before you run the cell containing **export**.
- Login to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) and upload the zip file into the p9 assignment.
- If you completed the project with a **partner**, make sure to **add their name** by clicking "Add Group Member"
in Gradescope when uploading the p9 zip file.

   **Warning:** You will have to add your partner on Gradescope even if you have filled out this information in your `p9.ipynb` notebook.
   
- It is **your responsibility** to make sure that your project clears auto-grader tests on the Gradescope test system. Otter test results should be available in a few minutes after your submission. You should be able to see both PASS / FAIL results for the 10 test cases and your total score, which is accessible via Gradescope Dashboard (as in the image below):

- **Important:** After you submit, you **need to verify** that your code is visible on Gradescope. If you displayed the output of a large variable (such as `movies`) anywhere in your notebook, **we will not be able to view or grade your submission**. Make sure you don't have any large outputs in any of your cells, and verify after submission that your code can be viewed.
- If you feel you have been incorrectly graded on a particular question during manual review, then you can find more about the Regrade Request process [here](https://piazza.com/class/l7f7vr5x63n7l1/post/320).
