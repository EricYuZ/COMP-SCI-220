## Instructions:

This project will focus on **loops** and **strings**. To start, download `p5.ipynb`, `project.py`, `p5_test.py` and `hurricanes.csv` . For each project, we will have you download a new `p5_test.py` - please make sure to download the correct files for the current project.

**Note:** Please go through [lab-p5](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p5) before you start the project. The lab contains some very important information that will be necessary for you to finish the project.

You will work on `p5.ipynb` and hand it in. You should follow the provided directions for each question. Questions have **specific** directions on what **to do** and what **not to do**. 

After you've downloaded the file to your `p5` directory, open a terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to that directory. To make sure you're in the correct directory in the terminal, type `pwd`. To make sure you've downloaded the notebook file, type `ls` to ensure that `p5.ipynb`, `project.py`, `p5_test.py`, and `hurricanes.csv` are listed. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter, and get started on the project!

**IMPORTANT**: You should **NOT** terminate/close the session where you run the above command. If you need to use any other Terminal/PowerShell commands, open a new window instead. Keep constantly saving your notebook file, by either clicking the "Save and Checkpoint" button (floppy disk) or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut.
