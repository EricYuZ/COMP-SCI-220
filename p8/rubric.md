# Project 8 (P8) grading rubric 

## Code reviews

- A TA / grader will be reviewing your code after the deadline.
- They will make deductions based on the Rubric provided below.
- To ensure that you donâ€™t lose any points in code review, you must review the rubric and make sure that you have followed the instructions provided in the project correctly.

## Rubric

### General guidelines:

- Outputs not visible/did not save the notebook file prior to running the cell containing "export". We cannot see your output if you do not save before generating the zip file. This deduction will become stricter for future projects. (-3)
- Used concepts/modules (ex: csv.DictReader, pandas) not covered in class yet (built-in functions that you have been introduced to can be used) (-3)
- import statements are not mentioned in the required cell at the top of the notebook or used additional import statements beyond those that are stated in the directions (-1)
- `get_movies function` called more than once on the full dataset (`movies.csv` and `mapping.csv`) or `bucketize_by_genre` function called more than once on the full list of movies (-3)
- Variables of large size (like `movies` and `genre_dict`) displayed in notebook (-3)
