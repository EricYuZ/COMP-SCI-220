## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will practice...
* Loading data in json files
* Loading data in csv files
* Using try/except to handle malformed data

------------------------------

## Note on Academic Misconduct

You may do these lab exercises only with your project partner; you are not allowed to start 
working on lab-p10 with one person, then do the project with a different partner. Now may be a 
good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f22/syllabus.html).

**Important:** p10 and p11 are two parts of the same data analysis.
You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects.
If you partner up with someone for p10, you have to sustain that partnership until end of p11.
**You must acknowledge that you have read this to your lab TA**.

------------------------------

## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab-p10` directory and download the following files into the `lab-p10` directory.

* `small_data.zip`
* `practice.ipynb`
* `practice_test.py`

After downloading data.zip, make sure to extract it (using [Mac directions](http://osxdaily.com/2017/11/05/how-open-zip-file-mac/) or [Windows directions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028088/windows-zip-and-unzip-files)). After extracting, you should see a folder called `small_data`, which has the following files in it:

* .DS_Store
* .ipynb_checkpoints
* mapping_1.json
* mapping_2.json
* mapping_3.json
* planets_1.csv
* planets_2.csv
* planets_3.csv
* stars_1.csv
* stars_2.csv
* stars_3.csv

You may delete `small_data.zip` after extracting these files from it.

**Important**: You **must** make sure that the `small_data` directory is in the same directory as `practice.ipynb`. Your file structure **must** look like this:

```
+-- practice.ipynb
+-- practice_test.py
+-- small_data
|   +-- .DS_Store
|   +-- .ipynb_checkpoints
|   +-- mapping_1.json
|   +-- mapping_2.json
|   +-- mapping_3.json
|   +-- planets_1.csv
|   +-- planets_2.csv
|   +-- planets_3.csv
|   +-- stars_1.csv
|   +-- stars_2.csv
|   +-- stars_3.csv
```

Confirm with your TA/PM that your file structure is correct before proceeding further.


## Segment 2: 
For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb`, and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

## Project 10

You can now get started with [p10](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p10). **You may copy/paste any code created here in project p10**. Remember to only work on p8 and p9 with your partner from this point on. Have fun!
