## Instructions:

This project will focus on **utilizing lists** and **managing dictionaries**. To start, download [`p7.ipynb`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/blob/main/p7/p7.ipynb), [`p7_test.py`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/blob/main/p7/p7_test.py), and [`water_accessibility.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/raw/main/p7/water_accessibility.csv).


**Note:** Please go through [lab-p7](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p7) before you start the project. The lab contains some very important information that will be necessary for you to finish the project.

You will work on `p7.ipynb` and hand it in. You should follow the provided directions for each question. Questions have **specific** directions on what **to do** and what **not to do**. 

After you've downloaded the file to your `p7` directory, open a terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to that directory. To make sure you're in the correct directory in the terminal, type `pwd`. To make sure you've downloaded the notebook file, type `ls` to ensure that `p7.ipynb`, `p7_test.py`, and `water_accessibility.csv` are listed. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter, and get started on the project!

**IMPORTANT**: You should **NOT** terminate/close the session where you run the above command. If you need to use any other Terminal/PowerShell commands, open a new window instead. Keep constantly saving your notebook file, by either clicking the "Save and Checkpoint" button (floppy disk) or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut.

## IMPORTANT Submission instructions:
- Review the [Grading Rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p7/rubric.md), to ensure that you don't lose points during code review.
- You must **save your notebook file** before you run the cell containing **export**.
- Login to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) and upload the zip file into the p7 assignment.
- If you completed the project with a **partner**, make sure to **add their name** by clicking "Add Group Member"
in Gradescope when uploading the p6 zip file.

- It is **your responsibility** to make sure that your project clears auto-grader tests on the Gradescope test system. Otter test results should be available in a few minutes after your submission. You should be able to see both PASS / FAIL results for the 20 test cases and your total score, which is accessible via Gradescope Dashboard (as in the image below):
