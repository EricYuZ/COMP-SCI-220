## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will practice...
* creating scatter plots,
* defining recursive functions.

------------------------------

## Note on Academic Misconduct

You may do these lab exercises only with your project partner; you are not allowed to start 
working on lab-p11 with one person, then do the project with a different partner. Now may be a 
good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f22/syllabus.html).

**Important:** p10 and p11 are two parts of the same data analysis.
You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects.
If you partnered up with someone for p10, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of p11.
**You must acknowledge that you have read this to your lab TA**.

------------------------------

## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab-p11` directory and download the following files into the `lab-p11` directory.

* `sample_data.zip`
* `planets_small.json`
* `practice.ipynb`
* `practice_test.py`
* `practice_plots.json`

After downloading `sample_data.zip`, make sure to extract it (using [Mac directions](http://osxdaily.com/2017/11/05/how-open-zip-file-mac/) or [Windows directions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028088/windows-zip-and-unzip-files)). After extracting, you should see a folder called `sample_data`. You may delete `small_data.zip` after extracting the files inside it.

**Important**: You **must** make sure that the `sample_data` directory is in the same directory as `practice.ipynb`. Your file structure **must** look like this:

```
+-- practice.ipynb
+-- planets_small.json
+-- practice_test.py
+-- practice_plots.json
+-- sample_data
|   +-- .DS_Store
|   +-- file_1.json
|   +-- sample_1
|   |   +-- .ipynb_checkpoints
|   |   +-- file_2.json
|   |   +-- file_3.json
|   +-- sample_2
|   |   +-- file_4.json
|   |   +-- sample_3
|   |   |   +-- .DS_Store
|   |   |   +-- file_5.json
```

Confirm with your TA/PM that your file structure is correct before proceeding further.


## Segment 2: 
For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb`, and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

## Project 10

You can now get started with [p11](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p11). **You may copy/paste any code created here in project p11**. Remember to only work on p11 with your partner from this point on. Have fun!
