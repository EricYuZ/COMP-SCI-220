# Project 10 (P10) grading rubric 

## Code reviews

- A TA / grader will be reviewing your code after the deadline.
- They will make deductions based on the Rubric provided below.
- To ensure that you don’t lose any points in code review, you must review the rubric and make sure that you have followed the instructions provided in the project correctly.

## Rubric

### General guidelines:

- Displaying excessive irrelevant information (-3)
- Required outputs not visible/did not save the notebook file prior to running the cell containing "export" (-3)
- Used concepts/modules (like csv.DictReader, pandas) not covered in class yet (built-in functions that you have been introduced to can be used) (-3)
- Defined required functions or data structures more than once (-3) 
- Looping through a dictionary to get the value of a key instead of just accessing that key's value (-3)
- Hardcoded indices (-3)
- import statements are not mentioned in the required cell at the top of the notebook or used additional import statements beyond those that are stated in the directions (-3)
- Used the output of the os.listdir function directly (without removing all files and directories that start with ".", and sorting the list) (-3)
- Used bare try/except blocks (without explicitly specifying the type of exceptions that need to be caught) (-3)
- Bad coding practices are used. Refer to Coding Style Requirements to understand few instances of bad coding practice (-1)
